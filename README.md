# EECS233
Projects from EECS233 Intro to Data Structures
Assignments from EECS233 Intro to Data Structures, all written in Java using Eclipse. Assignments include small homework coding and some projects.


Project 1 consists of making a list of numbers by using an ArrayList and a LinkedList.


Project 2 consists of making a "HuffmanEncoder." This is not a true Huffman Encoder because there is no binary bit maniupluation.
The program uses Huffman encoding to read an inputted .txt file's characters, generate what the encoded values would look like 
in binary by creating a Huffman tree, and then writing to an output file a string of 0's and 1's to represent what the 
encodings are.


Project 3 consists of creating a HashTable using seperate chaining to keep track of unique words in an inputted file. 
The word was used as the key and the word's respective frequency was used as the value. The words and their respective 
frequencies were then written to an output file.
